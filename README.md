# Definitions of Security and Privacy Taxonomy Terms
1. **Access Control:**  
   Access control involves managing users' access to resources provided by an IoT network or IoT device. A key attraction of IoT is its capability to enable data and service sharing between devices, which raises security concerns and underscores the importance of implementing an access control framework in IoT systems. Access control techniques are crucial system components in protecting IoT systems.

2. **Anonymity:**  
   This refers to scenarios in which the user would prefer to remain anonymous and hide their identity. They may be fearful of their identity being exposed. It can also refer to rendering the activity of one group invisible to other groups, such as in a classroom, enterprise, or social media setting. Technologies such as VPNs can offer a degree of anonymity.

3. **Authentication:**  
   Authentication is the process of verifying the identity of a user attempting to access a network or device. The proof of identity can be based on "something I am," "something I have," or "something I know."

4. **Authorization:**  
   Authorization refers to the process of deciding whether an authenticated entity (a user or device) is allowed to access resources within an IoT network. The authorization process is typically managed through groups, roles, privileges, and permissions.

5. **Availability:**  
   In the context of IoT, availability refers to ensuring that the network or device is accessible whenever the user requires it. This is particularly crucial when a device is replaced with a new one, as the new device should be able to access or retrieve historical data.

6. **Confidentiality:**  
   Confidentiality refers to the protection of sensitive data generated, transmitted, and stored by IoT devices, ensuring that it is only accessible to authorized users or systems. It prevents interception or disclosure of information as it flows across networks, which is especially critical in IoT due to the vast number of interconnected devices and the frequent transmission of data over public or unsecured networks. Confidentiality in IoT is often achieved through mechanisms like encryption, secure communication protocols, and access control measures.

7. **Consent:**  
   Consent refers to the user's sense that they have agreed to or authorized the collection, storage, sharing, and use (such as for personalization) of their data. Consent includes the concept of opt-out when users refuse consent for a specific type of data collection and use. It also includes the idea of forced consent, which is when users have to consent to the collection of a specific type of data simply in order to use an app or service.

8. **Data Accuracy:**  
   Maintenance of the accuracy, consistency, and reliability of data throughout its lifecycle to prevent corruption, alteration, or unauthorized changes that could compromise trust or reliability.

9. **Data Collection:**  
   This refers to the collection of personally identifying information (such as email, phone number, address), behavior activity data (from sensors, IoT devices and personal devices), as well as the collection of user-generated content. When this is useful for app functionality, it is considered purposeful and acceptable. When there is no direct purpose, it is viewed as unnecessary and a privacy violation. Collecting the minimal amount of personal data needed for the core functionality of a smartphone app, IoT skill, or web service is considered a privacy best practice.

10. **Data Deletion:**  
    This usually refers to personal data that a user wants to delete. Examples include generated content such as files, photos, and videos. Other examples include behavior history such as cookies, search history, browsing history, and activity history. It can also include personally identifying information such as profile information.

11. **Data Exposure:**  
    This refers to scenarios when a user's personal data is disclosed in a way that is beyond the user's ability to control. This can include sharing personal data with third parties, advertisers, developers, governments, social media, and the public. This includes the notion of selling data to third parties (often for ads) in ways that are opaque to users.

12. **Data Harms:**  
    Safety concerns arise out of privacy problems when a user's personal data is inaccurate or obsolete. When such data is shared or misused, it can lead to misattribution, which could cause physical or mental harm, such as blackmail or coercion.

13. **Data Hiding:**  
    In data hiding concerns, users express a desire to explicitly hide their personal data. It can refer to a broad range of data, including calendars, photos, albums, videos, contacts, messages, playlists, notes, etc. They often want to know where the controls are to do so, how they work, and exactly what kind of data hiding is achieved.

14. **Data Management and Storage:**  
    Data Management and Storage in IoT involves the secure handling, analysis, and transformation of data through various operations, algorithms, and workflows to maintain privacy, integrity, and confidentiality. It also encompasses the reliable retention and protection of data in storage systems, whether on local devices, databases, or cloud platforms, to prevent unauthorized access, data loss, or corruption. Together, these processes ensure that user data is managed and stored with a focus on security, accessibility, and compliance with privacy standards.

15. **Data Security and Data Theft:**  
    Data security is a privacy problem when accounts or enterprises are breached, and the attacker gathers users' personally identifying information and personal data, which is gathered and/or leaked. The strength of authentication mechanisms has a direct impact on the likelihood of account hacking and, thus, subsequently on the downstream event of private data theft.

16. **Data Sharing:**  
    This refers to the sharing of personal data that the user can or should be able to control. It includes accidental or unintended sharing when the user inadvertently makes a mistake with the UI or doesn't understand the sharing controls. It also includes forced sharing (when a user is forced to share some data just to use the app or cross-app sharing occurs), and the user does not feel consent was given freely. This can also refer to the types of privacy controls for sharing, such as password protection for photos, files, calendars, etc.

17. **General Comments Related to Security and Privacy:**  
    Broad observations or reflections on privacy and security practices, policies, or challenges. This theme includes general sentiments, critiques, or concerns about the handling of security and privacy issues, such as overall trust in data protection practices, perceptions of safety, the adequacy of security measures, or the importance of privacy controls. These comments are not tied to specific incidents but reflect overarching views on the effectiveness, transparency, and ethical considerations of security and privacy practices.

18. **Location Tracking:**  
    The collection of location data that enables location tracking is so widespread that this is its own category. A user's location data can be collected at varying levels of granularity. Privacy controls to limit location tracking are often hard to discover and use in a consistent fashion. Multiple location controls can cause user confusion.

19. **Personalized Advertising:**  
    When sharing or selling a user's data for advertising purposes is a form of data exposure, this taxonomy item is called out separately because it is known to be very pervasive. Personalized advertising is based on users' data; users sometimes find this unwanted and/or creepy. Sometimes, paid services can be a way to reduce or eliminate ads.

20. **Policies and Law:**  
    Privacy policies are how apps, IoT services or web services declare the privacy practices they follow to their users. Different countries and jurisdictions around the world have various privacy laws that developers who operate in those countries are liable to adhere to.

21. **Privacy Controls:**  
    This refers to the privacy controls users employ to hide their personal data to explicitly control data collection or sharing. Privacy controls are sometimes hard to find within a user interface or not sufficiently explained to the user, and the user is not sure exactly what these controls do. Privacy controls or settings are a way to express privacy preferences. This can also include parental controls or refer to controls to download one's personal data.

22. **Privacy Ethics:**  
    This refers to ethical concerns that arise when privacy data is leaked and personal information is used to offer unequal or biased services to specific groups of people. It also encompasses the moral implications of individuals exhibiting self-righteous attitudes toward privacy, using humor or sarcasm to express privacy concerns, and expressing personal skepticism and opinions about privacy practices. Furthermore, it addresses the ethical dilemma of recognizing privacy concerns while remaining indifferent to their implications and the trade-off between privacy and utility, where individuals may sacrifice their privacy for perceived benefits or conveniences.

23. **Secure Communication:**  
    Secure communication in IoT refers to the protection of data and services exchanged between devices, which are transferred through various communication patterns, including telemetry, inquiries, notifications, and commands. These communication channels must be secured to ensure the privacy and confidentiality of the information being shared.

24. **Security Vulnerabilities:**  
    Security Vulnerabilities are weaknesses or points of exposure in IoT devices and systems that can be exploited by attackers to perform malicious actions. In the context of IoT, these vulnerabilities contribute to a broad attack surface, which includes various risks, such as communication attacks, device exploitation, and dynamic attacks. Attackers can leverage these vulnerabilities using a range of tools and malicious code, potentially compromising device integrity, data privacy, and system functionality.

25. **Software and Firmware Updates:**  
    Software and firmware updates refer to the processes of regularly updating and configuring security features in IoT devices to address emerging threats and vulnerabilities. While many mobile and desktop operating systems automatically perform these updates, IoT devices often receive infrequent updates due to their limited numbers and heterogeneous nature.

26. **Surveillance:**  
    Surveillance is a privacy concern related to feeling one is being spied on or monitored without awareness or consent. Spying can happen via sensors (such as cameras, microphones, activity sensors, and location trackers) on users' devices. It can also occur from devices users do not control, such as satellites, drones, neighbors' cameras, enterprise audio, and video capture devices, and so on.

27. **Trust and Transparency:**  
    Trust entails establishing confidence, and assurance in the integrity of systems, services, or interactions, fostering positive relationships and user satisfaction. Transparency refers to how well apps, devices, and services communicate to users what private data they collect, the purpose of the data collection, and how users can control that process.

28. **Usability:**  
    Ensuring that privacy controls, settings, and interfaces are intuitive, effective, and user-friendly, enhancing user experience and promoting privacy awareness.
